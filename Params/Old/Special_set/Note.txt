this is a special set to test the phase change of stimulus 

During experiment, change valus of x_pos to:

1) x_pos = 960 (45 degree)
2) x_pos = 1440 (67.5 degree)
3) x_pos = 1920 (90 degree)
4) x_pos = 2400 (112.5 degree)
5) x_pos = 2880 (135 degree)

Before attempting to run at these locations separetaly, try putting a looper vector 

x_pos [960,1440,1920,2400,2880]
